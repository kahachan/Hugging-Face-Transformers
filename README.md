## Overview

Welcome to the "Introduction to Natural Language Processing with Hugging Face Transformers" repository! This project is a comprehensive guide to delve into the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the powerful Hugging Face Transformers library. NLP is a field at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics, focusing on the interaction between computers and human language. In this repository, we explore various NLP tasks, from basic tokenization to advanced text generation and sentiment analysis.

### What's Covered

- **Tokenization and Text Encoding**: Understand the basics of converting text into machine-readable format.
- **Building and Fine-tuning Models**: Dive into the process of creating and fine-tuning NLP models.
- **Text Generation**: Explore the capabilities of generating human-like text using pre-trained models.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze and classify the sentiment expressed in textual data.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identify and classify named entities in text.

This project is designed to provide a hands-on experience with Hugging Face Transformers, enabling you to apply these concepts to real-world projects and gain valuable insights into NLP.
